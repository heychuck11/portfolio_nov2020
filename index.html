        <span>I was born on November, 11th 1990 in Rochester, New York. A place known for its passion for sports, garbage plates, and snow (At least there it knows when to snow like in December, not September). I grew up loving sports, playing sports especially hockey. My favorite teams to root for are the Buffalo Sabres and the Buffalo Bills. Movies and video games are another passion of mine that watching movies The Matrix being my favorite but I also like many variety as well. Music I'm very close minded I only like my genre of blink-182, new found glory, sum 41, and of course my all time favorite Angels and Airwaves. My life I have been trying to achieve my ultimate dream of becoming a big time film maker, I've taken courses learning the basics of directing, writing, and editing. I write my own screenplays to create my worlds that I plan to share with the world and I believe this career path in coding can help. I was interested in coding to see all the work behind web writing software to help with web, security, animation, video games, and visual effects.</span>
